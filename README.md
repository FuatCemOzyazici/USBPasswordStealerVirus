# USBPasswordStealerVirus
When you run it, it will save all stored Google Chrome passwords in Passwords.txt

Google Chrome stores password in a database called "Local Data".
With the use of SQLite, I can open up the database and get usernames.
However passwords are crypted, that's why I used a special decryption function to decrypt them.

This project can only be used for educational purposes.
